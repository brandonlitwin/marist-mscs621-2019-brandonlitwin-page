# Technology Intro
The Anime Tracker combines AWS with a Docker container running a Flask server and a SQLite database. The process of updating the site is very easy. After directly updating and testing the source code, it can be put in a ZIP file and placed directly into a Docker container on the AWS ElasticBeanstalk service.

# Marketing
The current state of the site may be small, but there exists a large market of anime viewers who want to keep track of what they watch. The long term goal of the Anime Tracker is to become a social hub for anime fans who want to discuss the latest shows together. The following Sales section describes potential sponsors that can assist with the marketing of the site.

# Sales
Although it is free to make an account on this site, there is potential for advertising. If the database grows to add more and more current anime, and the userbase grows to the thousands, there can be a large market for advertisements. These can consist of sponsors from anime streaming sites like Crunchyroll, anime media marketplaces like Right Stuf, promotions for the latest anime, and promotions for upcoming anime conventions.

# Costs
The long term costs of the site will increase with demand. Right now, the AWS ElasticBeanstalk is running on the free tier. Since the processing power required is very low, we can remain safely in the lowest Memory capacity of 2 GB. For the first year, we can run 750 hours per month for free. After that, the on-demand pricing for the lowest tier is $0.0255 per hour.

# Conclusion
With low costs and a large market potential, the profits could be huge!
